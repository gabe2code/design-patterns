# Abstract Factory

```The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.```

The Abstract Factory design pattern solves problems like:

How can an application be independent of how its objects are created?
How can a class be independent of how the objects it requires are created?
How can families of related or dependent objects be created?
