# Singleton

```In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.```

The singleton design pattern solves problems like:[6]

How can it be ensured that a class has only one instance?
How can the sole instance of a class be accessed easily?
How can a class control its instantiation?
How can the number of instances of a class be restricted?
How can a global variable be accessed?
