# Builder

```The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.```

The Builder design pattern solves problems like:[2]

How can a class that includes creating a complex object be simplified?
