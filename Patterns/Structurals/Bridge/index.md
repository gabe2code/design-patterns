# Bridge

```The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently"```


What problems can the Bridge design pattern solve?

```An abstraction and its implementation should be defined and extended independently from each other.```

```A compile-time binding between an abstraction and its implementation should be avoided so that an implementation can be selected at run-time.```
